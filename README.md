Technology:
==========

Asp.Net Core

Project's goal:
===================

The economy is increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few powerful corporations. This application aims to help balance the market. This is due to the exchange of information on prices of products or services between employees. When going around searching for prices, employees collect this data through the application. All of this marketing information is automatically shared on the maisbarato.app website. In the app, the employee accesses the prices of the products he collected and visualizes the prices collected by the other users of this tool - you help here and someone helps you out there!

Preliminary:
============

Create the SQL database and run the SQL-SCRIPT-EXPORTS / Full-Script-20201119.sql script.
Fill in the "CheapestAppEntities" connection string in appsettings.json.
